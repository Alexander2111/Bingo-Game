# Bingo-Game
A  game coded with Python

# Inroduction
This is a basic desktop game currently in its very initial stage. I am working on adding more efficient algorithms. For now it is just as simply coded as it could be to fulfill the necessary requirements for the game.

# Description
The short version of the following description is explained in the beginning of the game.
1. Enter your username
2. Create your 5x5 Bingo Grid
3. The grid should comprise only of numbers from 1 to 25
4. The numbers must be entered one by one i.e. one row after another according to your tactics (Just press enter after each input, the code will automatically set your 25 inputs in the right way, as a 5x5 matrix) and the games starts!
5. Try to cross out 5 rows and/or columns before your opponent (i.e. the PC)
6. You can only enter one number of choice at a time
7. In the end the winner will be declared
